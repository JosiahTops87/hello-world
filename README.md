Hi there.

My name is Josiah Reynolds.  I am a new Software Developer.  I am trying to learn how to better my coding skills and would just like to work on many different projects.  I want to become a talented developer.  I also really love programming.  I can't wait to see how fast I can improve my own skills while working with others.
